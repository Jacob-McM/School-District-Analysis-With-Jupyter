    "So, this area of code I personally think looks both nice and ugly. Nice because I think that it is all very legible, each block is seperated by grade and the merge cells create what I think is a nice indent between each block. Also, if I'm understanding correctly these blocks are applicable to any grading data in this format, so it is at least versatile. What I think is ugly is the fact that there are 4 seperate cells 9 lines long needing 3 merges to get to the final dataframe. Sometime later when I have the time and knowledge I want to come back and see if there's a better way to do this. I'm also going to refrain from commenting inside the cells themselves and will instead comment their function here, since they are all functionally the same; \n",

    "What each cell does is create a DataFrame from .loc of all the values .loc finds in `[Grade]` from the grade_scores dataframe that are exactly the same as (==) the specified grade, in the case of the first one its \"9th\". The columns are renamed because debugging would be kind of annoying if the headers of every cell were the same, and because when the final merged DataFrames ninth_tenth_m and eleventh_twelfth_m are merged if the columns aren't renamed the merge will not work and an error will occur. After the rename, the index is set as the school name and then grouped by the school name. The mean of the group is sent to the final DataFrame, which is what is the data seen in the final DataFrame.\n",

    "This is my final report and thoughts based on my reports found under each table below. To summarize, Charter schools far outscore District schools in every recorded area, with the closest being a difference of 2.93 in Average Reading Scores in favor of Charter Schools. Charter schools are also smaller than every school District schools, with the smallest difference in students being 456 students between Ford High School(2739) and Wilson High School(2283) and the largest difference being 4,549 students between Bailey High School(4976) and Holden High School (427). The Total School budget also seems to scale based on total student population. \n",
    "\n",
    "My thoughts are that the most insightful information would probably come from comparisons of Ford High School and Wilson High School, who have a difference of 456 students, a difference that is negligible when compared to the consistency in scores that the respective high schools share with schools of the same type with a similar or greater difference in students. Ford High School also has budget $444,342 greater than that of Wilson, all the while Wilson has the lowest budget per student district wide and is the 4th highest overall performer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting observation I see between these two schools is the drasticity in their comparative scores, and how little a difference the observations made above matter in the consistency in the scores of related school types. 89-90% overall passing in charter schools across the entirety of charter schools, 52-54% overall passing in district schools across the entirtey of district schools. I'll finish my thoughts with this final question - What is Wilson High School doing to the scale of Ford High School that the rest of the Charter schools are doing that is not happening at the District schools?
